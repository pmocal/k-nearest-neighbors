For multiple groups of `n` points with a certain class `c` I assigned the class whose points were closest on average
to my point `p`.

Run either `knnvalidation.py`, which prints out the errorcount, or `knntest.py` to label images in `/digitsDataset`.
Expect the programs to take a few minutes to complete. Data is read from `/digitsDataset` and results are also written
to that directory. There is a `README` inside it detailing the nature of the datasets.
